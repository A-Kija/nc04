                    Names for the species include the common raccoon,[7] North American raccoon,[8] and northern
                    raccoon.[9] In various North American native languages, the reference to the animal's manual
                    dexterity, or use of its hands is the source for the names.[10] The word raccoon was adopted into
                    English from the native Powhatan term meaning 'animal that scratches with its hands', as used in the
                    Colony of Virginia. It was recorded on John Smith's list of Powhatan words as aroughcun, and on that
                    of William Strachey as arathkone.[11] It has also been identified as a reflex of a Proto-Algonquian
                    root *ahrah-koon-em, meaning '[the] one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands'.[12] The word
                    is sometimes spelled as racoon.[13]

                    The English word beaver comes from the Old English word beofor or befor and is connected to the
                    German word biber and the Dutch word bever. The ultimate origin of the word is an Indo-European root
                    for 'brown'.[2] The genus name Castor has its origin in the Greek kastor and translates as
                    'beaver'.[3] The name beaver is the source for several names of places in Europe including Beverley,
                    Bièvres, Biberbach, Biebrich, Bibra, Bibern, Bibrka, Bobr, Bjurbäcker, Bjurfors, Bober, Bóbrka and
                    Bjurlund.[4]

                    The word fox comes from Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic *fuhsaz.[nb 1] This in turn
                    derives from Proto-Indo-European *puḱ-, meaning 'thick-haired; tail'.[nb 2] Male foxes are known as
                    dogs, tods or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though the last name is
                    not to be confused with a distinct species called kit foxes. Vixen is one of very few words in
                    modern English that retain the Middle English southern dialect "v" pronunciation instead of "f"
                    (i.e. northern English "fox" versus southern English "vox").[3] A group of foxes is referred to as a
                    skulk, leash, or earth.[4][5]

                    The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
                    Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin
                    word for the animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[5][6] The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the
                    species.[7]

                    Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or
                    suffix in their names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"), Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf
                    ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone") Æðelwulf
                    ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"), Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"), Wolfgang
                    ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil ("Wolf Runner").[8]

                    Alces alces is called a "moose" in North American English, but an "elk" in British English.[2] The
                    word "elk" in North American English refers to a completely different species of deer, Cervus
                    canadensis, also called the wapiti. A mature male moose is called a bull, a mature female a cow, and
                    an immature moose of either sex a calf.

                    A male rabbit is called a buck; a female is called a doe. An older term for an adult rabbit used
                    until the 18th century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once
                    referred only to the young animals.[2] Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is
                    often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones.
                    More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit.

                    Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have confirmed that mice have a range of
                    facial expressions. They used machine vision to spot familiar human emotions like pleasure, disgust,
                    nausea, pain, and fear.[6][7][8]
